This is the source code for the Typography for Lawyers [web-based book](http://typographyforlawyers.com), which is an abbreviated version of the [paperback](http://typo.la/oc).

The website is built with [Pollen](http://pollenpub.com). I’m sharing this code as a Pollen sample project. Because when I’m trying to learn a new programming tool, I prefer to study real projects rather than synthetic examples.

To run this project, you need to first install [Racket](https://github.com/racket/racket) and [Pollen](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen).

## Installation

Using Racket 6.0+, install from the command line:

    raco pkg install pollen-tfl
    
And update like so:

    raco pkg update --update-deps pollen-tfl


## Documentation
    
Scribble documentation is provided for the main `pollen.rkt` file. (Search for the `pollen-tfl` module in the Racket docs.)

Other source files contain comments.

You can also read the docs [online, right now.](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen-tfl/)


## But this repo is not open source

Everything in this repository belongs to me and not you.

I give you permission to use this repo to learn about Pollen, including running and modifying the files.

I also give you permission to reuse or adapt any of the Racket & Pollen source code, or JavaScript / CSS / HTML, for your own Racket & Pollen projects.

I do **NOT** give you permission to reuse any of the content of this web-based book (including text, images, and PDFs), nor the fonts that are embedded in the CSS. Why not? Because that’s the stuff I sell for money so that I can keep [Pollen](http://pollenpub.com) itself under the LGPL. Let’s not mess with a good thing.

If you have questions not covered here, please post them on the Pollen mailing list: http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pollenpub
